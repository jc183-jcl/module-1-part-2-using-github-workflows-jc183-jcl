# Simple Linear Regression in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** for performing a simple linear regression on data stored in a CSV file.  
It asks the user for a CSV path and column names, fits a regression line, prints the results, and plots the data with the regression line.

---

## Features
- Load data from a CSV file
- Fit a simple linear regression (`y = m*x + b`)
- Print slope, intercept, and R²
- Visualize data and regression line with Matplotlib
- Display equation and R² on the plot
